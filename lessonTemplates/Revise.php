      <p>It's pretty unusual for a project to turn out perfectly the first time you put it together. So part of building anything is taking a hard look at it after you've got the basics pulled together. Here are some tricks for making a good project great:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sleep on it a night or two. Giving yourself a little time away from looking at your work will let you see it in a new light. You'll probably spot things you missed or could have done better.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Review the assignment and the driving questions again. Those are your guiding star to make sure you're heading in the right direction. If you can't specifically describe how your project relates to the driving questions, try to find a way to make it more on target.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Ask people what they think. First, ask them to describe what they see and what they think it means. Then ask what they like about it. Do they see how the project relates to the driving questions? Do they think all the parts of the project fit together and make sense? What do they think you could have done better? Are there parts they don't understand? Are there things you could add (or remove) that would make it better?</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Try to receive feedback&mdash;even negative feedback&mdash;with an open mind. It's hard to hear criticism. The idea of asking for feedback, though, isn't to look for criticism; it's to look for ideas on how you can improve your work. So listen to what people say with an eye toward specific things you can do to make your project look or work better. If the person doesn't have anything specific and constructive to say, just thank them for their help and move on to another person.</li>
      </ul>
