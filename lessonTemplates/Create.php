      <p>Great! Here are some tips to keep in mind:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Before you dig in, think about your project from as many angles as you can. The idea is to get a really clear picture in your mind of what your final work will look like.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Think about time: Will you be able to do all the things you need to, as well as you'd like, in time to meet your deadline? If not, are there parts of the project you can simplify or leave out?</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Once you've got a good picture in your mind, think about all the things you'll need to have to make the project. It's a good idea to make a detailed list so you can check off each item as you get or make it.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Before you start building, take another look at the instructions you got from your teacher. Will your project meet all the requirements?</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Look again at the Driving Questions: Can you see how the work you're about to do relates to the questions? If not, can you think of changes you can make to strengthen the connection?</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Choose the best tools for the job (and make sure you know how to use them or can learn quickly). If you want to describe something, you can write about it. Or, it might be even better to make a video. If you want to gather information from other people, maybe there's a social network tool like a blog or wiki you can use to let friends, classmates, and others contribute whenever they'd like.</li>
      </ul>
