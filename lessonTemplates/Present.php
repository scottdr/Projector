      <p>Chances are you'll be presenting your challenge work to your class and others as well. You&rsquo;ll also produce work digitally (podcasts, web pages, wikis, for example) and the old-fashioned way, such as keeping a journal. No matter how you present your project, it's a great idea to put some thought into how you want people to see it. These tips will help you present your project in the best possible light:</p>
      <p><strong>Tips for presenting digital projects:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>If your project uses digital content, make sure it all works.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Be sure pictures are clear and have captions (and spelled correctly!).</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Be sure voices and music are loud enough (but not too loud).</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>If you publish your content on a web page, make sure you review the page very carefully to look for mistakes or pieces you've left off. The same goes for any kind of digital work: it's easy to forget a photo, video, or web link now and then. Check all the elements of your project to make sure they work.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Tips for presenting your project in person:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Plan what you want to say. Look over the driving questions and assignment (again!) and write down the key parts of your project that highlight your answers to the questions.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Practice! Here's what the pros do: They stand up and give their entire presentation&mdash;either to a friend or two, or even just a mirror. They don&rsquo;t talk about what they'll say&mdash;they actually <em>say</em> what they'll say in person. That way, they can tell if an idea doesn't work or if there's a better way to say something. They can also tell if their presentation is too long or too short.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Be ready to answer common questions. You'll have thought through your project really well by the time you're ready to present it. But take a minute to make notes to have handy when you talk: that way if you forget a detail you'll be able to take a quick peek and get back on track.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Tips for reflecting on your project:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Think about your project from beginning to end. What did you think when you first heard about the challenge?</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>How did your thinking change over time? Did the project sound hard at first and then get easier? Or, was it the other way around? What made it hard or easy?</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>How did you overcome problems?</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>What did you learn about how to plan, improve, and present your work?</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>What parts of the challenge made you think about everyday life differently? Did you learn a new skill that helps you in other areas? Did you learn about a part of history that changes how you understand the world around you?</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>If you were to do this project again, what would you want to do differently? Were there more things you wanted to do but didn't have time or materials to complete?</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Did the challenge give you new ideas about ways to get involved in your community? Has it encouraged you to do something different?</li>
      </ul>
