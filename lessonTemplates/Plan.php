      <p>You&rsquo;re ready to build your project, but before you start, you need a plan.</p>
      <p>A project plan can be as simple as a written list of the tasks that you need to complete and the date or time by which you need to finish them. The more complicated the project, the more detailed your plan.</p>
      <p>When you work in a team, it&rsquo;s even a little more complicated: It&rsquo;s very important to write a plan that is very specific about who is going to do what&mdash;and by when. If your assignment is to edit photos, you need to know that the teammate who is responsible for taking the pictures hands them off to you in plenty of time for you to complete your task. You can&rsquo;t edit them if you don&rsquo;t have them.</p>
      <p>Your teacher will probably want you to use a particular format for your project plan. Working in your team, fill the form out with as many details as you can think of. Be sure that everyone on your team understands their role and the timeline you&rsquo;ve all agreed to. Be sure to go back to the project plan at least once a day to see if you&rsquo;re on track.</p>
